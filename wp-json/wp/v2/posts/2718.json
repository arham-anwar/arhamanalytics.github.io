I was asked to create this tool in order to better manage our valuable human resources and to make sure no one was overworked. The steps of the pipeline are below &#8211;<\/p>\n<p>Step one: Team members fill in the weekly timesheets through an excel workbook on cloud storage for all hours, including commute, team meals, meetings, weekend hours (if any), paid time offs, vacations, holidays etc. As soon as they would fill the timesheets, the timesheets would get sent to my folders through macros on the workbook.<\/p>\n<p>Step two: When all workbooks reach my timesheets folder, a python code is executed which consolidates the 75 workbooks, removes duplicate rows, removes blank rows, fixes erroneous entries and validates the total hours.<\/p>\n<p>Step three: The code sends the cleaned and consolidated file to the project managers through email using smtbl library.<\/p>\n<p>step four: Tableau Dashboards are automatically refreshed for all since the dashboards are linked to a csv file on the drive with a live connection.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Impact<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increased visibility into overworked resources &#8211; more often than not, new resources tend to overwork to compensate for their lack of experience. In order to avoid employees from falling into this trap and helping them develop awareness of their calendars, this tool has been immensely helpful<\/li>\n<li>Project allocation &#8211; In management consulting, many believe the best norm for one is to be allotted on at most 2 projects at a time. However, in logistics, this practice can lead work to concentrate over few busy weeks, and can lead to some weeks with no work at all. In order to better manage project hours, this tool provides hours spent by employees on each project. When a project gets really busy, other team members pool in.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Timesheets Bot is a tool designed for team resource optimization for a power team of 30 in the India office and 45 in the New York office.
