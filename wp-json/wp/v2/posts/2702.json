This is a story of concentration.<\/p>\n<p>We have standardized weight breaks on the X-axis. On Y axis we have a dual axis situation with the bars representing the count of shipments (which is calculated by taking a unique count of Freight Bill Number), and the trend line represents the spend of the corresponding weight break. As we can see, most of the shipments seem to be Parcel, with weight range being approximately zero to 150 Lbs. Despite the company spending most of its efforts on Parcel, a very high fraction of the total spend actually comes from Air Freight, which corresponds to less than 5% of the shipments.<\/p>\n<p>It might not surprise many when data is presented in this fashion using this super simple chart, however, to many companies this is news.
